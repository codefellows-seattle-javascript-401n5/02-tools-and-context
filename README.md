something is wrong with my linter settings, vscode is no longer giving me the option to fix indent problems, which is causing linter errors with travis.  I am able to manually fix each line that it errs on, but this is dumb.

--  problem fixed itself?
--- had to reinstall eslint in the root of the lab repo, everything worked with all of my whiteboard challenges, nothing worked with any of my labs

i don't think this is the right way to do this, but I was having trouble figuring out how to target the specific values it was returning.  It kept failing the tests because it was trying to compare an object to an expected value.  The best workaround I could find was to create a second list within each test function containing the expected output and comparing it to the input list.

need to rewrite a simpler filter method, i'm getting bogged down in problems that don't need solving
