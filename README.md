something is wrong with my linter settings, vscode is no longer giving me the option to fix indent problems, which is causing linter errors with travis.  I am able to manually fix each line that it errs on, but this is dumb.

--  problem fixed itself?
--- had to reinstall eslint in the root of the lab repo, everything worked with all of my whiteboard challenges, nothing worked with any of my labs
